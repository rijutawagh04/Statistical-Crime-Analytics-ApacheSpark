Crime Analytics
Crime analysis is a systematic approach for identifying and analyzing patterns and trends in Crime. Crimes have a negative effect on any society both socially and economically. Law enforcement bodies face numerous challenges while trying to prevent crimes.
Our project can show regions which have high probability for crime occurrence, visualize crime prone areas, forecast the crimes occurrence and analyze the crime rates over the years. This helps to perform descriptive, predictive, and prescriptive analysis on crime data. With the increasing advent of computerized systems, crime data analysts can help the Law enforcement officers to speed up the process of solving crimes. Instead of focusing on causes of crime occurrence like criminal background of offender, political enmity etc we are focusing mainly on crime primary types of each day.
